# Repeated project verification reportedly consumes overnight budget

## Symptom

A September 17 follow-up reports 98 recursive verification runs consuming approximately 98 dollars overnight without producing further project work.

## Repro

Correlate run and tool ledgers, parent IDs, loop/routine configuration, completion checks and provider usage for the affected night. Distinguish separate scheduled passes from in-run verification continuations.

## Evidence

Fresh support follow-up reviewed September 19. sidecar/loopjob.js has dry-stop and red-streak controls and budget accounting; test/loops-endurance.e2e.test.js covers lifecycle but cannot establish this incident cause. Related older uncertainty: acb47320. No affected run ledger was supplied.

## Verdict

Open P2 under the existing uncorrelated-report triage rule; prioritize evidence because reported cost is material. Do not merge this incident into generic idle usage or invent a successful reproduction. Need authorized account reconciliation and exact background-work configuration.

## Investigation (2026-10-03)

loop-breaker.js DEFAULTS: unknown=3 strikes, failure streak stop=8, no-progress stop=5. These apply on unattended runs. For Ollama: free so no budget risk; but loop prevention still fires.
